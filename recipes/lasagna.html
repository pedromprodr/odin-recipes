    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        We took a couple shortcuts for this recipe by using store-bought marinara and boxed pasta sheets. It saves a ton of time without sacrificing any flavor. We think it's absolutely perfect as-is, but also understand some people are looking to make sauce from scratch. If that's the case for you, try out our best homemade spaghetti sauceâ€”simple in ingredients and rich in flavor, it'll never let you down.

        Lasagna noodles need structure, especially because they have a lot of ingredients layered between them! You don't want to make 'em too mushy, which can be easy to do accidentally because they're cooked twice: once in the boiling water, and once in the oven. Make sure to cook them until they're very al dente in the boiling stage: They're ready typically 2 to 4 minutes before the amount of time on the box! Don't listen to the box of lies and look instead for the thin white line in the middle of your noodle when you go in to take a little test nibble.
